Programming Pizzeria! - use WASD or the Arrow keys to select the correct crust shape, sauce type, and toppings to complete customer orders. Completing lots of orders correctly in a row will increase the score quickly! Failed orders will subtract from the score and increase the failed order counter. Customers will only wait so long for their food, move quickly!
